# EtinuxE Explained 

## How Marova works
Marova behaves like a living organism with feelings. The system keeps track of hunger, energy for dreams, sleep quality, stress (toxicity), and overall mood. Whenever someone feeds Marova, logs a memory, or starts a sleep or dream session, those numbers shift. The software then decides how Marova feels right now: happy, calm, agitated, distressed, and so on.

## Mood types
Marova can be neutral, happy, excited, relaxed, calm, sad, angry, agitated, distressed, or depressed. Good sleep and positive memories lead to upbeat moods. Bad sleep, stressful memories, or too much dream debt push Marova toward the darker moods.

## What shapes Marova's behaviour
- **DNA data**: Health and metabolism reports for the humans connected to Marova act like a blueprint. If the people are tired or unhealthy, Marova feels fragile and hungrier.
- **Memories**: Every memory log carries a feeling score, a strength, and how toxic it is. Pleasant, vivid memories clean away stress and recharge dream energy. Harsh memories add toxicity and make nightmares likelier.
- **Personality**: Emotional surveys describe how the community feels. From those answers the system gives Marova traits such as sensitivity, resistance to stress, and tolerance for intense dreams.

## Personality assessments in plain terms
1. People submit how they have been feeling and, optionally, a short story.
2. The system looks at the mix of positive and negative feelings.
3. It turns that into three sliders: how sensitive Marova is, how well she shrugs off toxic memories, and how comfortable she is with powerful dreams.
4. The new sliders immediately change how Marova reacts to the next events.

## DNA profiling, tokens, and nodes
- **Profiles** are regular health check summaries. They help the system understand Marova's baseline body.
- **DNA tokens** are like backup batteries. When Marova does not have enough dream energy, she can borrow from these tokens. Sleep slowly refills them.
- **Miniaturization tokens** link people who have been shrunk down into Marova's support crew. They make sure each human helper has an energy reserve.

## Memory forms
- **Memory tokens** reward the team for sharing memories; they show how often people contribute.
- **Memory nodes** are the memories themselves, organised like a mind-map. Related memories are connected as neighbours so that dreams can flow naturally between them.
- **Neighbouring concept** means that the system keeps track of which memories feel similar. When a dream starts, it picks a cluster of linked memories, which is why certain themes repeat until the toxicity is cleared.

## Why this matters
By combining DNA health, shared memories, and emotional surveys, EtinuxE makes Marova feel like a living reflection of the community. Keeping positive memories flowing, monitoring health, and guiding sleep routines keeps her balanced. Let those elements slip and she becomes stressed, dreaming turns risky, and the mood tilts toward distress.
